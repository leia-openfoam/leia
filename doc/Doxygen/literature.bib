	abstract = {It is well-known that the standard level set advection equation does not preserve the signed distance property, which is a desirable property for the level set function representing a moving interface. Therefore, reinitialization or redistancing methods are frequently applied to restore the signed distance property while keeping the zero-contour fixed. As an alternative approach to these methods, we introduce a modified level set advection equation that intrinsically preserves the norm of the gradient at the interface, i.e. the local signed distance property. Mathematically, this is achieved by introducing a carefully chosen source term being proportional to the local rate of interfacial area generation. The introduction of the source term turns the problem into a non-linear one. However, we show that by discretizing the source term explicitly in time, it is sufficient to solve a linear equation in each time step. Notably, without further adjustment, the method works in the case of a moving contact line. This is a major advantage since redistancing is known to be an issue when contact lines are involved. We provide a first implementation of the method in a simple first-order upwind scheme in both two and three spatial dimensions.},

	abstract = {In [6], the Ghost Fluid Method ({GFM}) was developed to capture the boundary conditions at a contact discontinuity in the inviscid compressible Euler equations. In [11], related techniques were used to develop a boundary condition capturing approach for the variable coefficient Poisson equation on domains with an embedded interface. In this paper, these new numerical techniques are extended to treat multiphase incompressible flow including the effects of viscosity, surface tension and gravity. While the most notable finite difference techniques for multiphase incompressible flow involve numerical smearing of the equations near the interface, see, e.g., [19, 17, 1], this new approach treats the interface in a sharp fashion.},
