# Branch feature/oneSidedGradientFvPatchField

Is for the development and testing of the oneSidedGradientFvPatchField BC.
It extrapolates boundary values by using the one-sided gradient difference formula of second order accuracy.
This formula is only valid at equidistant orthogonal cartesian meshes.
