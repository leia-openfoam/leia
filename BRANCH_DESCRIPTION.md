# Branch contact-point-postprocessing

This branch is for developing and testing around the functionObject `contactPoint`. 
It is responsible for writing the postprocessing data position, contact angle, curvature and |\grad \psi| of a contact point.
A contact point is the intersection of the interface between the phases and a wall.
Currently, this functionObject is limited to the 2Dcontactline test cases.
An implementation for the 3Dcontactline case may come in future.
