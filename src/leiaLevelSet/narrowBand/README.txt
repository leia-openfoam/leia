narrowBand/ is currently unused. Maybe, it will be removed.
Currently not in Make/files listed.


The temporarily named interfaceBand class hierachy will refactor and extend the narrowBand hierachy.
NarrowBand switch is disabled for SDPLSSource because effects seem not worth + would need some refactoring for using interfaceBand
