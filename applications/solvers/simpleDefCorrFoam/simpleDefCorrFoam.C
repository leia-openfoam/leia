Description
    Steady-state solver for incompressible, turbulent flows with 
    defect correction.

    \heading Solver details
    The solver uses the SIMPLE algorithm to solve the continuity equation:

        \f[
            \div \vec{U} = 0
        \f]

    and momentum equation:

        \f[
            \div \left( \vec{U} \vec{U} \right) - \div \gvec{R}
          = - \grad p + \vec{S}_U
        \f]

    Where:
    \vartable
        \vec{U} | Velocity
        p       | Pressure
        \vec{R} | Stress tensor
        \vec{S}_U | Momentum source
    \endvartable

    \heading Required fields
    \plaintable
        U       | Velocity [m/s]
        p       | Kinematic pressure, p/rho [m2/s2]
        \<turbulence fields\> | As required by user selection
    \endplaintable
